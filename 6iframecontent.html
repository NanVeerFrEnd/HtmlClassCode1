        <h3> The Birth of Jesus Foretold </h3>
        <p>
            
26 In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,<br>
 27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin’s name was Mary.<br>
  28 The angel went to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.”<br>

29 Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. <br>
30 But the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. <br>
31 You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. <br>
32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. <br>
The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, <br>
33 and he will reign over Jacob’s descendants forever; his kingdom will never end.”<br>

34 “How will this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?”<br>

35 The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High <br>
will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called[b] the Son of God.<br>
36 Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, <br>
and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. <br>
37 For no word from God will ever fail.”<br>

38 “I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May your word to me be fulfilled.” Then the angel left her.<br>
